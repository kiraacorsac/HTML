      The opossum (/əˈpɒsəm/ or /pɒsəm/) is a marsupial of the order Didelphimorphia (/daɪˌdɛlfɪˈmɔːrfiə/) endemic to
      the Americas. The largest order of marsupials in the Western Hemisphere, it comprises 110+ species in 19 genera.
      Opossums originated in South America and entered North America in the Great American Interchange following the
      connection of the two continents. Their unspecialized biology, flexible diet, and reproductive habits make them
      successful colonizers and survivors in diverse locations and conditions.[citation needed]
    </p>

    <p>
      In the United States and Canada, the only species found is the Virginia opossum. It is often simply referred to as
      an "opossum", and in North America they are commonly referred to as possums[3] (sometimes rendered as ’possums in
      written form to indicate the dropped "o"). They should not be confused with the Australasian arboreal marsupials
      of suborder Phalangeriformes that are also called "possums" because of their resemblance to the Didelphimorphia.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The word "opossum" is borrowed from the Powhatan language and was first recorded between 1607 and 1611 by John
      Smith (as opassom) and William Strachey (as aposoum).[4] Siebert reconstructs the word phonemically as
      /a·passem/.[5] "Possum" was first recorded in 1613. Both men encountered the language at the British settlement of
      Jamestown, Virginia, which Smith helped to found and where Strachey later served as its first secretary.[6]
      Strachey's notes describe the opossum as a "beast in bigness of a pig and in taste alike," while Smith recorded it
      "hath an head like a swine ... tail like a rat ... of the bigness of a cat."[6] The Powhatan word ultimately
      derives from a Proto-Algonquian word (*wa·p-aʔθemwa) meaning "white dog or dog-like beast."[6]</p>

    <p>Following the arrival of Europeans in Australia, the term "possum" was borrowed to describe distantly related
      Australian marsupials of the suborder Phalangeriformes,[7] which are more closely related to other Australian
      marsupials, such as kangaroos.</p>

    <p>They similarly have 'Didelphimorphia', two ("di") wombs ("delphus"), the second being a non-bilateral marsupial
      womb (nursing-pouch).[8]</p>

    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <p>Opossums are frequently considered to be "living fossils",[9] and as a result are often used to approximate the
      ancestral therian condition in comparative studies.[9][10] However, this is inaccurate, as the oldest opossum
      fossils are from the early Miocene (roughly 20 million years old).[11] The last common ancestor of all living
      opossums approximately dates to the Oligocene-Miocene boundary (only 23 million years ago) and is at most no older
      than Oligocene in age.[12][13] Many extinct metatherians once considered early opossums, such as Alphadon,
      Peradectes, Herpetotherium, and Pucadelphys, have since been recognized to have been previously grouped with
      opossums on the basis of plesiomorphies and are now considered to represent older branches of Metatheria only
      distantly related to modern opossums.</p>

    <p>Opossums were minor components of South American mammal faunas until the late Miocene, when they began to rapidly
      diversify.[12] Prior to this time the ecological niches presently occupied by opossums were occupied by other
      groups of metatherians such as paucituberculatans[14] and sparassodonts[13][15][16] Large opossums like Didelphis
      show a pattern of gradually increasing in size over geologic time as sparassodont diversity declined.[15][16]
      Several groups of opossums, including Thylophorops, Thylatheridium, Hyperdidelphys, and sparassocynins developed
      carnivorous adaptations during the late Miocene-Pliocene, prior to the arrival of carnivorans in South America.
      Most of these groups with the exception of Lutreolina are now extinct.[17]</p>
